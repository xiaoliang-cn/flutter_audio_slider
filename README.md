## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter
[plug-in package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that includes platform-specific implementation code for
Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

The plugin project was generated without specifying the `--platforms` flag, no platforms are currently supported.
To add platforms, run `flutter create -t plugin --platforms <platforms> .` under the same
directory. You can also find a detailed instruction on how to add platforms in the `pubspec.yaml` at https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#plugin-platforms.
